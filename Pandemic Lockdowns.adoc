Just writing some ideas.
I'm trying to figure out how to get people to put some new laws in place for the next pandemic or national emergency.
We know there is going to be one.
It might not be global but something is always going wrong somewhere.
The idea I am trying to work out is how to treat shutting down a city or state or country like shutting off a computer (don't worry ... I won't use this analogy) ...
Shutting down a computer is a set of very ordering steps which store needed information for the reboot which is presumed to come.
Naturally if the shutdown is the result of serious damage the restoration information will still be useful but for the reconstruction period.
The unlocking of society we see today is the same as a reboot.
We need to have protocols for what to shut down and how and for how long and then what to restart and when.

Questions like "compensation" for lost work and "essential" versus "non-essential" services need to be formalised.

We also need to put these in place to make sure the police and elected officials do not exceed their authority or use the opportunity to ram through highly undesirable social legislation (e.g.Trudeau banning all kinds of guns because the Parliament is not in session and he just gets to do it) by making any "orders in cabinet" during this period *automatically* go away once the emergency is over.

No country's "emergency measures" specify the process in detail.

The Navy has very carefully specified procedures for "mothballing" an aircraft carrier, for maintaining it while in mothballs, and for "restoring" a mothballed ship to active service.

A nation and its various institutions and economy is arguably more complicated than an aircraft carrier.

National "Emergency Powers" legislation is a few paragraphs long at most.
I can't even begin to imagine what the "How To Mothball an Aircraft Carrier" manual looks like.

The police also need protection from being given "illegitimate" rules by politicians. Vagueness allows politicians to invent interpretations (e.g. the governor of Michigan banning the sale of flower seeds) and the police are compelled to enforce these rules. This situation brings the police into conflict with society and erodes public confidence. This damage lasts a long time.

These are just a few of the ideas I'm trying to put out there.
I'm not having much luck.
